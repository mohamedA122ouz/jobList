const SomeElement = forwardRef(({orops},ref)=>{
  return <h1 ref = {ref}></h1>
});
```




### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/) - learn react from scratch.
- [React Forward Ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) - This is an amazing doc which helped me understand how to use forward Ref . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
